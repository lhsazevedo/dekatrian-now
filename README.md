## The Dekatrian Calendar
September is the month... SEVEN? Wroong, it's the month Nine. Nine as in November, which is actually 11. Each month has 30 days right? Or 31â€¦ or 28, who sometimes earn an extra day every 4 years.

Dekatrian is a simpler calendar proposal, which solves several problems in our calendar (Gregorian). In it, every month has 28 days - exactly 4 weeks.
